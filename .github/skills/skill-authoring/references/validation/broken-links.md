# Broken Link Verification

Check all markdown links in SKILL.md and referenced files.

## Procedure

1. Parse all `[text](path)` links in SKILL.md
2. For each link to a local file, verify the file exists
3. Recursively check links in referenced files
4. Flag any links where the target file is missing

## Link Requirements

### Always Link to Files, Not Folders

Links must point to actual files, not directories. Folder references don't trigger reference loading.

| ❌ Invalid | ✅ Valid |
|------------|----------|
| `[Recipes](references/recipes/)` | `[Recipes](references/recipes/README.md)` |
| `[AZD](references/recipes/azd)` | `[AZD](references/recipes/azd/README.md)` |
| `[Services](references/services)` | `[Services](references/services/README.md)` |

**Why this matters:**
- Agent skills only load content from file links
- Folder links are treated as broken links (no content loaded)
- Always use `README.md` (or another `.md` file) as the folder entry point

### Use Descriptive Link Text, Not Paths

Link text should describe the content, not repeat the URL or path. This saves tokens and improves readability.

| ❌ Wasteful | ✅ Concise |
|-------------|------------|
| `[references/guide.md](references/guide.md)` | `[Guide](references/guide.md)` |
| `[https://example.com/docs](https://example.com/docs)` | `[Docs](https://example.com/docs)` |
| `See [references/errors.md](references/errors.md)` | `See [Error Handling](references/errors.md)` |

**Avoid standalone reference columns in tables.** Instead of:

```markdown
| Error | Fix | Reference |
|-------|-----|-----------|
| Auth failed | Re-login | [references/auth.md](references/auth.md) |
```

Use inline links:

```markdown
| Error | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| [Auth failed](references/auth.md) | Re-login |
```

### Validation Check

When validating links, flag:
1. Links pointing to directories instead of files
2. Links to non-existent files
3. Links with incorrect relative paths
4. Links where text duplicates the URL/path

## When broken link found, ask user:

- a) **Fix reference** - Update the link path to correct location (add `/README.md` for folder links)
- b) **Delete link** - Remove the link from the document
- c) **Something else** - User provides alternative action

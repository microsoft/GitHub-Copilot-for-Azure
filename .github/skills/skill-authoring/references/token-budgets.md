# Token Budget Guidelines

Central reference for token limits across all skill files.

## Limits

| File Type | Soft Limit | Hard Limit | Action if Exceeded |
|-----------|------------|------------|-------------------|
| SKILL.md | 500 tokens | 5000 tokens | Split into references |
| references/*.md | 1000 tokens | 2000 tokens | Split into folder with README.md |
| docs/*.md | 1500 tokens | 3000 tokens | Restructure |

## Splitting Large References

When a reference exceeds 1000 tokens, convert to a folder structure:

```
# Before
references/large-guide.md    # 1500 tokens

# After
references/large-guide/
├── README.md                # Overview + links (~200 tokens)
├── section-1.md             # First section (~400 tokens)
└── section-2.md             # Second section (~400 tokens)
```

Update links: `[guide](references/large-guide.md)` → `[guide](references/large-guide/README.md)`

## Validation

```bash
cd scripts
npm run tokens -- check plugin/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md
```

## Why Token Limits Matter

> **Units note:** Limits are measured in **tokens** (cl100k_base tokenizer), not words. Anthropic's [Complete Guide](https://resources.anthropic.com/hubfs/The-Complete-Guide-to-Building-Skill-for-Claude.pdf) says "under 5,000 words" while the [Agent Skills spec](https://agentskills.io/specification) says "< 5000 tokens." As a rough conversion: 5000 tokens ≈ 3,750 words. Token-based limits are stricter.

- **Metadata (~100 tokens)**: Loads at startup for ALL skills
- **SKILL.md (<5000 tokens)**: Loads entirely on activation
- **References**: Load only when explicitly linked

Smaller files = faster activation, less context consumed.

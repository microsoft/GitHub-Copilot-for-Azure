# Sensei

> "A true master teaches not by telling, but by refining." - The Skill Sensei

Automates skill frontmatter improvement using the [Ralph loop pattern](https://github.com/soderlind/ralph) - iteratively improving skills until they reach Medium-High compliance with passing tests, then checking token usage and prompting for action.

## When to Use

- Improving a skill's frontmatter compliance score
- Adding trigger phrases and anti-triggers to skill descriptions
- Batch-improving multiple skills at once
- Auditing and fixing Low-adherence skills

## Invocation Modes

### Single Skill
```
Run sensei on azure-deploy
```

### Multiple Skills
```
Run sensei on azure-security, azure-networking, azure-observability
```

### By Adherence Level
```
Run sensei on all Low-adherence skills
```

### All Skills
```
Run sensei on all skills
```

## The Ralph Loop

For each skill, execute this loop until score >= Medium-High AND tests pass:

1. **READ** - Load `plugin/skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md`, tests, and token count
2. **SCORE** - Run rule-based compliance check (see [SCORING.md](references/SCORING.md))
3. **CHECK** - If score >= Medium-High AND tests pass → go to TOKENS step
4. **SCAFFOLD** - If `tests/{skill-name}/` doesn't exist, create from `tests/_template/`
5. **IMPROVE FRONTMATTER** - Add triggers, anti-triggers, compatibility (stay under 1024 chars)
6. **IMPROVE TESTS** - Update `shouldTriggerPrompts` and `shouldNotTriggerPrompts` to match
7. **VERIFY** - Run `cd tests && npm test -- --testPathPattern={skill-name}`
8. **TOKENS** - Check token budget, gather optimization suggestions
9. **SUMMARY** - Display before/after comparison with unimplemented suggestions
10. **PROMPT** - Ask user: Commit, Create Issue, or Skip?
11. **REPEAT** - Go to step 2 (max 5 iterations per skill)

## Scoring Criteria (Quick Reference)

| Score | Requirements |
|-------|--------------|
| **Low** | Basic description, no explicit triggers, no anti-triggers |
| **Medium** | Has trigger keywords/phrases, description > 150 chars |
| **Medium-High** | Has "USE FOR:" triggers AND "DO NOT USE FOR:" anti-triggers |
| **High** | Triggers + anti-triggers + compatibility field |

**Target: Medium-High** (triggers + anti-triggers present)

## Frontmatter Template

```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: |
  [1-2 sentence description of what the skill does]
  USE FOR: [trigger phrase 1], [trigger phrase 2], [trigger phrase 3]
  DO NOT USE FOR: [scenario] (use other-skill), [scenario] (use another-skill)
---
```

> **IMPORTANT:** Always use multi-line YAML format (`|`) for descriptions over 200 characters. Single-line descriptions become difficult to read, review, and maintain. See [azure-ai](../../plugin/skills/azure-ai/SKILL.md), [azure-functions](../../plugin/skills/azure-functions/SKILL.md) for examples.

> Keep total description under 1024 characters.

## Test Scaffolding

When tests don't exist, scaffold from `tests/_template/`:

```bash
cp -r tests/_template tests/{skill-name}
```

Then update:
1. `SKILL_NAME` constant in all test files
2. `shouldTriggerPrompts` - 5+ prompts matching new frontmatter triggers
3. `shouldNotTriggerPrompts` - 5+ prompts matching anti-triggers

**Commit Messages:**
```
sensei: improve {skill-name} frontmatter
```

## Constraints

- Only modify `plugin/skills/` - these are the Azure skills used by Copilot
- `.github/skills/` contains meta-skills like sensei for developer tooling
- Max 5 iterations per skill before moving on
- Description must stay under 1024 characters
- SKILL.md should stay under 500 tokens (soft limit)
- Tests must pass before prompting for action
- User chooses: Commit, Create Issue, or Skip after each skill

## Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--skip-integration` | Skip integration tests for faster iteration. Only runs unit and trigger tests. |

> ⚠️ Skipping integration tests speeds up the loop but may miss runtime issues. Consider running full tests before final commit.

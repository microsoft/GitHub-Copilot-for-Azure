# Examples

Before and after examples of frontmatter improvements, including token counts.

## Example 1: appinsights-instrumentation (Low → Medium-High)

### Before (Low Adherence)

**SKILL.md frontmatter:**
```yaml
---
name: appinsights-instrumentation
description: 'Instrument a webapp to send useful telemetry data to Azure App Insights'
---
```

**Metrics:**
- Score: Low
- Tokens: ~142
- Triggers: 0
- Anti-triggers: 0

**Problems:**
- ❌ Only 71 characters - too brief
- ❌ No trigger phrases
- ❌ No anti-triggers
- ❌ Agent doesn't know when to activate

**triggers.test.ts:**
```javascript
const shouldTriggerPrompts = [
  // Empty - no test coverage
];

const shouldNotTriggerPrompts = [
  'What is the weather today?',
  'Help me write a poem',
];
```

### After (Medium-High Adherence)

**SKILL.md frontmatter:**
```yaml
---
name: appinsights-instrumentation
description: |
  Instrument web applications to send telemetry data to Azure Application Insights
  for monitoring and diagnostics. USE FOR: "add App Insights", "instrument my app",
  "set up application monitoring", "add telemetry", "track requests and dependencies",
  "ASP.NET Core telemetry", "Node.js Application Insights". DO NOT USE FOR: querying
  existing logs (use azure-observability), creating alerts or dashboards, analyzing
  costs, or Azure Monitor metrics queries.
---
```

**Metrics:**
- Score: Medium-High ✅
- Tokens: ~385 (under 500 budget ✅)
- Triggers: 7
- Anti-triggers: 4

**Improvements:**
- ✅ 385 characters - informative but under 1024 limit
- ✅ Clear description of purpose
- ✅ Explicit "USE FOR:" trigger phrases
- ✅ "DO NOT USE FOR:" anti-triggers prevent collision

**triggers.test.ts:**
```javascript
const shouldTriggerPrompts = [
  'Add Application Insights to my web app',
  'Instrument my ASP.NET Core application for monitoring',
  'Set up telemetry for my Node.js app',
  'How do I track requests in App Insights?',
  'Add Application Insights monitoring to my project',
  'Configure App Insights for my Azure web app',
];

const shouldNotTriggerPrompts = [
  'What is the weather today?',
  'Help me write a poem',
  'Query my Application Insights logs',  // → azure-observability
  'Create an alert in Azure Monitor',     // → azure-observability
  'Show me my App Insights dashboard',    // → azure-observability
  'How much does App Insights cost?',     // → azure-cost-optimization
  'Help me with AWS CloudWatch',          // Wrong cloud provider
];
```

## Example 2: azure-security (Low → Medium-High)

### Before (Low Adherence)

**SKILL.md frontmatter:**
```yaml
---
name: azure-security
description: 'Azure Security Services including Key Vault, Managed Identity, RBAC, Entra ID, and Defender. Provides secrets management, credential-free authentication, role-based access control, and threat protection.'
---
```

**Problems:**
- ❌ Catalog-style description (lists services, not actions)
- ❌ No trigger phrases
- ❌ No anti-triggers
- ❌ Overlaps with azure-security-hardening, entra-app-registration

### After (Medium-High Adherence)

**SKILL.md frontmatter:**
```yaml
---
name: azure-security
description: |
  Overview of Azure security services and concepts including Key Vault, Managed Identity,
  RBAC, Entra ID, and Defender for Cloud. USE FOR: "Azure security overview", "what
  security services are available", "explain managed identity", "RBAC basics", "Key Vault
  concepts", "Entra ID overview", "Defender for Cloud features". DO NOT USE FOR: hardening
  existing resources (use azure-security-hardening), Entra app registration setup (use
  entra-app-registration), or role assignment guidance (use azure-role-selector).
---
```

**Improvements:**
- ✅ Reframed as "overview/concepts" skill
- ✅ Explicit triggers for educational queries
- ✅ Clear anti-triggers pointing to specialized skills

---

## Example 3: azure-deploy (Medium → Medium-High)

### Before (Medium Adherence)

**SKILL.md frontmatter:**
```yaml
---
name: azure-deploy
description: |
  Deploy applications to Azure App Service, Azure Functions, and Static Web Apps.
  USE THIS SKILL when users want to deploy, publish, host, or run their application
  on Azure. This skill detects application type and recommends optimal Azure service.
  Trigger phrases include "deploy to Azure", "host on Azure", "publish to Azure".
---
```

**Status:**
- ✅ Good trigger phrases
- ❌ Missing anti-triggers (collision with azure-create-app, azure-deployment-preflight)

### After (Medium-High Adherence)

**SKILL.md frontmatter:**
```yaml
---
name: azure-deploy
description: |
  Deploy applications to Azure App Service, Azure Functions, and Static Web Apps.
  USE FOR: "deploy to Azure", "host on Azure", "publish to Azure", "run on Azure",
  "azd up", "deploy my app", "push to Azure", "get this running in the cloud".
  DO NOT USE FOR: initial project setup (use azure-create-app), validating Bicep
  before deployment (use azure-deployment-preflight), or troubleshooting failed
  deployments (use azure-diagnostics).
---
```

**Improvements:**
- ✅ Added "DO NOT USE FOR:" section
- ✅ Clear handoff to related skills
- ✅ Prevents deployment vs. setup confusion

---

## Example 4: Test Prompt Patterns

### Good Trigger Prompts

```javascript
// Specific and actionable
'Deploy my Node.js app to Azure App Service'
'How do I publish a React app to Azure Static Web Apps?'
'Set up Azure Functions for my Python project'

// Uses skill keywords
'Run azd up to deploy my application'
'Host my web app on Azure'

// Natural variations
'I need to get my app running on Azure'
'Can you help me deploy to the cloud?'
```

### Good Anti-Trigger Prompts

```javascript
// Unrelated topics (always include some)
'What is the weather today?',
'Help me write a poem about clouds',
'Explain quantum computing',

// Other cloud providers
'Deploy to AWS Lambda',
'Host on Google Cloud Run',
'Push to Heroku',

// Related but different Azure services
'Validate my Bicep template',        // → azure-deployment-preflight
'Create an azure.yaml file',         // → azure-create-app
'Why did my deployment fail?',       // → azure-diagnostics
'How much will this deployment cost?', // → azure-cost-optimization
```

## Example 5: Commit Message

**Good commit message:**
```
sensei: improve appinsights-instrumentation frontmatter

- Added USE FOR trigger phrases: "add App Insights", "instrument my app", etc.
- Added DO NOT USE FOR anti-triggers: querying logs, creating alerts
- Updated triggers.test.ts with 6 should-trigger and 7 should-not-trigger prompts
- Score improved: Low → Medium-High
- All tests passing
```

**Minimal commit message (also acceptable):**
```
sensei: improve appinsights-instrumentation frontmatter
```

## Anti-Pattern Examples

### ❌ Don't Do This: Single-Line Long Description

```yaml
description: Identify and quantify cost savings across Azure subscriptions by analyzing actual costs, utilization metrics, and generating actionable optimization recommendations. USE FOR: optimize Azure costs, reduce Azure spending, analyze Azure costs, find cost savings. DO NOT USE FOR: cost estimation for new resources (use azure-cost-estimation).
```

**Problem:** Single-line descriptions over 200 characters are hard to read, review, and maintain. Use multi-line YAML format (`|`) instead:

```yaml
description: |
  Identify and quantify cost savings across Azure subscriptions by analyzing actual costs,
  utilization metrics, and generating actionable optimization recommendations. USE FOR:
  optimize Azure costs, reduce Azure spending, analyze Azure costs, find cost savings.
  DO NOT USE FOR: cost estimation for new resources (use azure-cost-estimation).
```

### ❌ Don't Do This: Overly Long Description

```yaml
description: |
  This skill helps you instrument your web applications to send telemetry data
  to Azure Application Insights which is a feature of Azure Monitor that provides
  extensible application performance management (APM) and monitoring for live
  web applications. It supports a wide variety of platforms including .NET, Node.js,
  Java, and Python. Application Insights can be used to monitor request rates,
  response times, failure rates, dependency tracking, page views, user counts,
  exceptions, and much more. You can use this skill when you want to add App
  Insights to your app, instrument your application, set up monitoring, add
  telemetry, or track requests. Do not use this skill if you want to query logs
  or create dashboards or set up alerts because those are handled by other skills.
  [... continues for 1200+ characters ...]
```

**Problem:** Exceeds 1024 character limit, too verbose.

### ❌ Don't Do This: Vague Anti-Triggers

```yaml
description: |
  Deploy apps to Azure. USE FOR: deployment.
  DO NOT USE FOR: other stuff.
```

**Problem:** Too vague - agent can't determine what "other stuff" means.

### ❌ Don't Do This: Mismatched Tests

```yaml
# SKILL.md says:
USE FOR: "deploy to Azure", "host on Azure"
```

```javascript
// But triggers.test.ts has:
const shouldTriggerPrompts = [
  'Create a new Azure project',  // Wrong! This is azure-create-app
  'Validate my Bicep file',      // Wrong! This is azure-deployment-preflight
];
```

**Problem:** Test prompts don't match the actual trigger phrases.

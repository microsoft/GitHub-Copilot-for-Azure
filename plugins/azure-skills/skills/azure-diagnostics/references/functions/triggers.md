# Trigger & Binding Troubleshooting

Diagnostics for HTTP, Timer, Queue, Blob, Service Bus, Cosmos DB, and Flex Consumption.

## HTTP Trigger

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| 404 on known route | Route template mismatch or function not indexed | Check `route` in `function.json`/attribute; confirm the function loaded via `az functionapp function list` |
| 500 on every request | Unhandled exception in the function | Query `exceptions` in App Insights for the stack trace |
| 408 / timeout | Execution timeout or gateway idle timeout | `functionTimeout` controls execution, but HTTP responses still have a 230-second platform limit. For long work, return 202 with a status endpoint or use Durable HTTP APIs |
| 401/403 unexpected | Function-level auth key mismatch, or Easy Auth intercepting the route | Verify `authLevel`; check `az webapp auth show` if App Service Authentication is enabled |

```kusto
requests
| where toint(resultCode) >= 400
| order by timestamp desc
| take 50
```

## Timer Trigger

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Timer never fires | Invalid NCRONTAB expression | Validate the schedule with an NCRONTAB parser; check `TZ`/`WEBSITE_TIME_ZONE` if the schedule assumes a non-UTC zone |
| Timer fires twice | `runOnStartup` adds invocations as hosts start, or another app/slot runs the schedule | Set `runOnStartup` to `false` in production and inventory deployments. Normal scale-out isn't the cause: a blob lease allows one scheduled invocation per app |
| Timer never fires or runs late | Host storage is unavailable, the app is stopped/disabled, or the host ID collides with another app using the same storage | Check `AzureWebJobsStorage`, host storage permissions, `AzureFunctionsWebHost__hostid`, and `Host.Triggers.Timer` traces. Always On applies only to Dedicated plans; Consumption and Flex timers are designed to wake from zero |
| Missed-run catch-up not happening | Schedule monitoring is disabled | Set `useMonitor` to `true` when catch-up is required. It defaults to `true` for intervals of at least one minute and `false` for more frequent schedules |

## Queue Trigger

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Message never processed | Poison message after `maxDequeueCount` (default 5) retries | Message moved to `<queue>-poison`; inspect it to find the root cause |
| Duplicate processing | Host stopped after side effects but before message deletion, or another consumer read the queue | The Functions host renews visibility during an invocation; `visibilityTimeout` controls retry delay after failure. Check host restarts and make side effects idempotent |
| Function stops triggering | Storage authentication fails | Re-check `AzureWebJobsStorage` and `Host.Listener` traces for `StorageException` |

```bash
# Peek poison messages
az storage message peek --queue-name "<queue>-poison" --account-name <account> --num-messages 32
```

## Blob Trigger

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Trigger delayed by minutes | Blob-trigger polling (non-Event Grid path) scans the container on a timer | Switch to the Event Grid-based blob trigger (`source: "EventGrid"`) for near-real-time triggering |
| Trigger never fires for a version | A receipt already exists for that blob path and ETag | Overwriting the blob creates a new ETag and should trigger. To reprocess the same version, delete only its matching receipt after confirming duplicate side effects are safe |
| Trigger fires for the wrong container | `path` pattern too broad or missing container scoping | Tighten the `path` binding expression (e.g. `samples-workitems/{name}`) |

## Service Bus Trigger

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Message stuck retrying | `MaxDeliveryCount` exceeded, moved to dead-letter | Inspect the dead-letter sub-queue for the underlying exception |
| `MessageLockLostException` | Execution exceeds lock renewal, or high prefetch lets locks age before processing | For single-message triggers, reduce work/prefetch or increase `maxAutoLockRenewalDuration` (default 5 minutes). It doesn't apply to batches; batch processing must finish within the entity's lock duration. Use manual renewal only with `autoCompleteMessages: false` and exposed message actions |
| No messages arriving | SAS key rotated, or namespace network rules block the Functions host | Verify the connection app setting; check namespace firewall/VNet rules if not using a private endpoint |

```text
# View dead-letter message contents
# Azure CLI does not support peeking Service Bus dead-letter message bodies directly.
# Use one of the following instead:
#   - Service Bus Explorer in the Azure portal (namespace -> Queues -> <queue> -> Dead-letter)
#   - An Azure Service Bus SDK (.NET, Java, Python, or JavaScript) with a receiver scoped
#     to "<queue>/$DeadLetterQueue", using a peek or receive operation.
```

## Cosmos DB Trigger

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Independent apps receive only part of the feed | Apps share a lease container and prefix, so they load-balance one logical processor | Give each independent workflow a unique `leaseContainerPrefix`, or use a dedicated lease container |
| No changes delivered | Lease container missing, or `createLeaseContainerIfNotExists` is false without a pre-created container | Verify the lease container exists; grant the identity/connection write access to it |
| Missing/default fields or deserialization failure | Bound model doesn't match document shape, casing, or schema version | `StartFromBeginning` only controls initial feed position and is ignored after checkpoints exist. Compare the document with the bound type, then inspect it through a supported raw JSON type (`JsonElement`, `string`, or `JObject`) |
| Feed replays from the start unexpectedly | New lease container, or `StartFromBeginning: true` with no existing leases | Expected on first deployment; set `StartFromBeginning: false` (default) after backfill. It only affects lease creation with no prior checkpoint |

For a manually created lease container, use partition key `/id`. The trigger identity needs
read/write access to lease items. Multiple triggers can share that container only when each
uses a unique `leaseContainerPrefix`.

## Flex Consumption Specifics

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Cold start despite "always ready" expectation | No always-ready instance for the function's scale group | Configure `http`, `durable`, `blob`, or `function:<FUNCTION_NAME>` with `az functionapp scale config always-ready set` |
| Can't reach a VNet-integrated resource | VNet integration not configured, or NSG/route table blocking egress | Confirm subnet delegation and outbound rules; enable VNet route-all if all egress must go through the VNet |
| Deployment succeeds but scaling is capped | Maximum instance count or the regional subscription memory quota is exhausted | Inspect `az functionapp scale config show -g RG -n APP`; check **Usage + quotas** for the subscription and region |
| Binding fails after dependency changes | Mixed Functions programming models or incompatible binding-extension versions | Use one programming model and align its binding packages. .NET isolated apps use `Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.*`; non-.NET apps using extension bundles should not also install the same binding extensions manually |

## Integration Testing Trigger Failure Paths

Assert the failure path, not just the happy path:

- **Queue**: force failure; confirm the message reaches `<queue>-poison` after `maxDequeueCount`.
- **Service Bus**: exceed lock renewal; confirm retries don't duplicate side effects.
- **Cosmos DB**: omit a required field; assert a clear deserialization error.
- **HTTP**: verify long work returns 202 instead of waiting past the gateway limit.

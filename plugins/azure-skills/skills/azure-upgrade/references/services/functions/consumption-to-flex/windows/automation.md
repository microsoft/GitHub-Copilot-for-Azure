# Automation: Consumption to Flex Consumption Upgrade

> Azure CLI scripts to automate the upgrade from Windows Consumption plan to Flex Consumption plan.
>
> **Shell compatibility**: Scripts use a universal subset that runs unchanged in:
>
> - bash 5.x (Cloud Shell, WSL, macOS, Linux)
> - PowerShell 7.x on any OS
>
> Secret-handling steps provide separate Bash and PowerShell 7 blocks when the shells require different cleanup or quoting syntax. Step 4c uses `jq` for the Bash in-memory JSON transform and `ConvertFrom-Json` / `ConvertTo-Json` for PowerShell.
>
> Replace `<PLACEHOLDERS>` (e.g. `<APP_NAME>`, `<RESOURCE_GROUP>`) with literal values before running each command. Each `az` command is a single line for cross-shell safety; conditional steps are described in prose between code blocks.
>
> **Source docs**: [Windows migration guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/migration/migrate-plan-consumption-to-flex?pivots=platform-windows)
>
> `az functionapp flex-migration` does not support Windows. All migration steps are performed using raw Azure CLI commands.
>
> ⚠️ **Source-app safety invariant**: All discovery and replication steps treat the source app as read-only. Before any command that changes the source app's settings, triggers, state, deployment, bindings, or existence, use `ask_user` to describe the exact command and impact and obtain explicit approval. Approval applies only to that specific action.
>
> ⚠️ **Workflow continuity**: After each step succeeds, immediately perform the next read-only preflight. If the next action requires approval, invoke `ask_user` in the same turn. Never stop after only announcing the next step and wait for the user to re-engage.
>
> 📍 **Progress reporting**: Create and maintain `<UPGRADE_DIR>/upgrade-status.md` using [Migration Progress](progress-tracking.md). Derive the current and total phases and executable steps from the workflow headings, then display the same `Phase <current> of <total> · <step> · <description> · <state>` banner before and after every step. Do not use percentages.

The headings inside these files remain the source of truth for stable step IDs and progress tracking. The table defines execution order; filenames describe responsibilities and do not encode ordering.

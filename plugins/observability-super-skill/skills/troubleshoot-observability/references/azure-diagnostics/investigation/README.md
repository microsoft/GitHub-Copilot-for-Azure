# Investigate the affected path

This is the investigation workflow within `azure-diagnostics`, not another
discoverable skill. Follow the parent entry's execution boundaries. Copilot
chooses the path below; tools execute only approved operations. Instructions
and offline tests do not establish host activation or live access.

## Standalone availability gate

Check availability before every cross-skill reference read or handoff below.
Use available shared guidance unchanged in the bundle; individual installation
may omit it. Never download, install or require a missing sibling-file read.
Without trace guidance, retain the local schema, scope/window and read/row caps,
use only sufficient existing authorized operations and disclose material gaps;
no bulk reconstruction or invented operations. Without the complete SRE
contract, skip optional SRE review and continue direct evidence analysis.
Without next-action guidance, return evidence and one smallest supported
fix/rollback plan-review question, or the smallest missing evidence, preserving
stops and separate approvals. Missing recovery instructions block that handoff,
not the investigation; never claim recovery. If the optional sibling portal
helper is absent, use a verified existing source link or omit the URL.

## 1. Retain the selected incident

Use the uniquely named symptom or developer-selected ranked finding exactly.
If several findings remain, present their original ranks and ask the developer
to select; never assume rank 1 consent or substitute an easier finding.
Do not run a mandatory broad health assessment or reassessment. Retain:

- confirmed tenant/subscription/deployment and target/dependency ARM IDs;
- application-to-source association, actual query surface/schema and freshness;
- UTC incident/baseline window, quantified failures, latency and existing alerts;
- representative operation/trace/span IDs and separate application conversation IDs;
- recent deployment/configuration changes, intentional faults and fixture constraints;
- evidence references, approval ceiling, consumed and remaining read budgets.

Missing scope gets one specific clarification or an approved safe lookup, not
a restart of onboarding. Synthetic facts are fixtures, not production evidence.

## 2. Choose the execution path explicitly

**Direct telemetry (default):** use supplied sanitized evidence or existing
authorized public tools. No Python, Azure CLI, authentication,
local save or new connection is required for supplied-evidence analysis.
An ordinary request to investigate selects this path and never authorizes
new external-service operations. Continue to step 3.

For material missing trace parents/handoffs, compare current filtered retrieval
with exposed Azure Monitor TraceStore operations using the shared
[trace capability reference](../../trace-capabilities.md).
Propose the smallest applicable approved lookup from the symptom, without
waiting for MCP to be named or requiring advanced analysis/a separate server.
Fresh confirmed source/schema facts are reusable; no-query and declines stop
that branch. This does not select an optional service.

Explain the choice using scenario fit, sufficient operations, verified access
and side effects. If direct evidence answers the question, return that finding
without redundant service delegation. This does not suppress the chat-level
[next-action offer](../../next-actions.md).
Optional service follow-up requires a real
unanswered question or explicit request. For an existing connected SRE Agent,
follow the shared [recommendation-only SRE contract](../../specialists.md#optional-existing-sre-agent):
verified connected/source proof and a specific advantage may justify one chat
review offer, never automatic delegation. Review acceptance is not execution
approval; unknown controls block execution. Explicit requests enter review
without another recommendation prompt.
Preserve scope, evidence, declines and remaining budgets across any handoff.

Before any reads, state `azure-diagnostics`, chosen path, retained scope/window,
actual discovered operations, data limits and blockers. Afterward distinguish
instructions loaded, operations executed and fallback used. Never claim a
sibling skill loaded from a Markdown reference.

## 3. Investigate only unanswered material boundaries

Start with the selected failure mechanism and the smallest discriminating
question. Reuse existing evidence. Default ceiling: six total reads, at most
one hour, 50 aggregate rows per result and two representative operations.
An inherited tighter ceiling wins; schema discovery/correction and retries
consume remaining reads. Stop when answered or budget exhausted. One corrected
schema query and one transient retry are permitted only within that ceiling;
never retry denial or an explicit no-retry instruction. Ask before widening.

Discover actual tool names, child operations and input schemas. Reuse the
parent [schema snapshot](../references/execution-boundaries.md#discovered-schema-snapshot-discovery-only)
only as discovery guidance. In particular:

Follow the shared [trace capability reference](../../trace-capabilities.md)
checkpoint before nontrivial distributed trace reconstruction and at truncated
results, missing/disconnected parents, repeated joins or material source-identity
gaps. For a material unresolved cap/parent/correlation issue, show its concise
**Trace capability decision** before requesting the next evidence pass or budget:
existing-path sufficiency, candidate availability/eligibility uncertainty and
bounded choice. Once per material issue; do not defer to cloud checks or force
MCP use. Continue sufficient approved narrow KQL with an explicit rationale.
Use that reference
for server-side population, critical-path and top-attribute analysis versus
representative retrieval. No coordinator load is implied. Prefer sufficient
existing authorized server-side operations regardless of API/MCP transport;
retrieval-only gaps do not authorize bulk download or local reconstruction.
If unavailable, retain these limits and disclose the missing reference.

- Component resource queries use candidates `requests`/`dependencies`,
  `timestamp`, `duration`, `customDimensions`; workspace queries use candidates
  `AppRequests`/`AppDependencies`, `TimeGenerated`, `DurationMs`, `Properties`.
  Confirm table/column/key presence and duration units; the backing workspace
  does not change a component endpoint's query dialect.
- Use source-appropriate Monitor logs/metrics for application, dependency and
  trace boundaries. Use AppLens for an unanswered platform/resource diagnostic
  question when its actual resource-name/type/scope schema fits; Resource Health
  for platform availability. Do not spend the budget on irrelevant platform
  checks or treat provisioning metadata as health.
- Reconstruct each selected failed tool/dependency chain through parent/child
  spans, exception, endpoint category, timeout/retry budget, structured semantic
  status, retries and fallback. Separate transport success, semantic failure,
  caught exceptions, framework lifecycle success and parent-agent outcome.
  Follow [bounded trace patterns](references/trace-query-patterns.md).
- For plausible AKS/cache pressure, use [managed Prometheus](references/managed-prometheus.md)
  where available. `InsightsMetrics`/`Perf` cannot substitute for unavailable
  exporter scrape, throttling, OOM or Redis evidence. Running pods/zero restarts
  do not disprove pressure. Discover metric names/labels before assuming them.
- Correlate deployment/configuration timing only when material. Prefer existing
  change evidence or bounded activity/deployment metadata. Never enumerate
  secret-bearing app settings or retrieve secrets before projecting them away.
- For Foundry, retain AI-specific analysis from `microsoft-foundry`; use
  [agent routing](references/foundry-agent-routing.md) for the application/dependency
  boundary. Do not loop back to Foundry or health for the same question.

Maintain a caller probe ledger: `passed`, `recovered`, `failed`,
`permission_gap`, `not_required`, with source/window and reason. Separately
label missing, denied, empty, stale, throttled, failed, malformed, truncated and
partial evidence. None proves health or an instrumentation gap by itself.
Never collect raw prompts, bodies, secrets, environment or unrestricted logs.
Do not install, log in, change identity, send traffic or run bundled scripts.
The optional Prometheus helper needs separate exact local-execution/network
approval; ordinary tool availability is preferable.

## 4. Validate findings before claiming a cause

Compare every claim with retained observations, timing, counterevidence and
coverage. Correlation is not causation. A completed service run or successful
command does not validate its findings. Use the
[confidence attribution rubric](references/confidence-assessment.md):
direct-path confidence is `caller-assessed`; distinguish any external service
claim from that assessment and retain disagreements. Do not fabricate percentages.
Insufficient material evidence yields **INCONCLUSIVE**, even if some probes pass.
Intentional fixture/design notes cannot raise confidence without runtime evidence.

## 5. Return a chat-first investigation and approved-fix handoff

Include selected finding/rank, affected scope/window, observed mechanism versus
causal hypothesis, confidence source/basis, a compact evidence table (values,
timestamps, correlation/source), causal chain, ruled-out alternatives,
contradictions, probe gaps and remaining uncertainty. Propose the smallest
evidence-backed fix as an **unexecuted option**, conditional on intentional
behavior constraints, plus at most one confirming check per unresolved boundary.
Name validation criteria and guardrails. No edits, remediation or recovery
claims follow from investigation permission.

Offer a compact Mermaid path only when it clarifies verified relationships.
Do not generate HTML, Grafana/workbooks or save evidence automatically.
Include available verified evidence links; never invent two or three links to
meet a quota. The [portal-link reference](references/portal-links.md) reuses the
existing packaged health helper rather than duplicating it.

Finish direct, evidence-only and service-return results using
[the result-to-next-action contract](../../next-actions.md):
state the stage and offer the smallest supported fix/rollback plan review with
one question unless stopped/declined; unresolved cause calls for evidence.
This is not permission to edit, deploy, collect or save.
After completed plan review, use the same contract's implementation continuation:
ask for missing source or propose the exact minimal edit for separate approval.

After an actual separately approved change, offer comparison and hand retained original and supplied
post-change evidence/thresholds to `verify-observability-fix`. Do not reassess
health or infer recovery/cause from recommendations, deployment status or a
service's completed status.

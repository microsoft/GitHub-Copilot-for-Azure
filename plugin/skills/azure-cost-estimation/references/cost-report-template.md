## Assumptions & Disclaimers

> **Important:** These are estimates only. Actual costs may vary.

- Pricing based on **Pay-As-You-Go retail rates** (not customer-specific pricing)
- 730 hours per month assumed for compute resources
- Storage costs exclude egress and transaction costs
- Does not include support plans, marketplace offerings, or third-party services
- Enterprise Agreement (EA) or CSP customers may have different rates
- For customer-specific pricing, use `az consumption pricesheet show`

| `timestamp` | Report generation time | `2024-01-15T10:30:00` |
| `monthly_total` | Sum of all monthly costs | `$1,234.56` |
| `yearly_total` | Monthly total * 12 | `$14,814.72` |
| `resource_count` | Number of priced resources | `8` |

## Resource Breakdown Fields

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `name` | Resource name from template | `myVirtualMachine` |
| `type` | Short resource type | `virtualMachines` |
| `sku` | SKU/size | `Standard_D4s_v3` |
| `monthly` | Monthly cost | `$140.16` |
| `notes` | Additional info | `Linux`, `Premium SSD` |

## Common Recommendations

1. **Reserved Instances**
   - VMs with steady usage (>70% utilization)
   - Expected savings: 30-72%
   - Terms: 1-year or 3-year

2. **Right-sizing**
   - Over-provisioned VMs
   - Use Azure Advisor recommendations

3. **Region Optimization**
   - Compare costs across regions
   - Consider latency requirements

4. **Hybrid Benefit**
   - Use existing Windows/SQL licenses
   - Expected savings: Up to 40%

5. **Spot Instances**
   - For interruptible workloads
   - Expected savings: Up to 90%

## Warning Categories

| Category | Example |
|----------|---------|
| Price not found | SKU not available in region |
| Parameter unresolved | Template uses undefined parameter |
| Dynamic resource | Auto-scale or consumption-based |
| Deprecated SKU | SKU may be retired |

## Example Report

```markdown
# Azure Cost Estimation Report

**Template:** `infra/main.bicep`
**Region:** eastus
**Generated:** 2024-01-15T10:30:00

---

## Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Total Monthly Cost** | $856.43 |
| **Total Yearly Cost** | $10,277.16 |
| **Resources Analyzed** | 5 |

---

## Resource Breakdown

| Resource | Type | SKU | Monthly Cost | Notes |
|----------|------|-----|-------------|-------|
| app-vm | virtualMachines | Standard_D4s_v3 | $140.16 | Linux |
| db-server | flexibleServers | Standard_D2s_v3 | $125.56 | PostgreSQL |
| storage | storageAccounts | Standard_LRS | $23.00 | Hot tier |
| app-plan | serverfarms | P1V2 | $146.00 | Premium |
| cache | Redis | C2 | $421.71 | Standard |

---

## Cost Optimization Opportunities

- Consider 3-year reserved instance for app-vm: Save ~$607/year (36% reduction)
- Review cache sizing - C1 may be sufficient for development

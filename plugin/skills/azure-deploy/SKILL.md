name: azure-deploy
description: |
  Execute deployment to Azure. Final step after preparation and validation. Runs azd up, azd deploy, or infrastructure provisioning commands.
  USE FOR: run azd up, run azd deploy, execute deployment, provision infrastructure, push to production, go live, ship it, deploy web app, deploy container app, deploy static site, deploy Azure Functions, bicep deploy, terraform apply.
  DO NOT USE FOR: creating or building apps (use azure-prepare), validating before deploy (use azure-validate).

# Azure Deploy

> **AUTHORITATIVE GUIDANCE — MANDATORY COMPLIANCE**
>
> **PREREQUISITE**: The **azure-validate** skill **MUST** be invoked and completed with status `Validated` BEFORE executing this skill.

> **⛔ STOP — PREREQUISITE CHECK REQUIRED**
> Before proceeding, verify BOTH prerequisites are met:
>
> 1. **azure-prepare** was invoked and completed → `.azure/plan.md` exists
> 2. **azure-validate** was invoked and passed → plan status = `Validated`
>
> If EITHER is missing, **STOP IMMEDIATELY**:
> - No plan? → Invoke **azure-prepare** skill first
> - Status not `Validated`? → Invoke **azure-validate** skill first
>
> **⛔ DO NOT MANUALLY UPDATE THE PLAN STATUS**
>
> You are **FORBIDDEN** from changing the plan status to `Validated` yourself. Only the **azure-validate** skill is authorized to set this status after running actual validation checks. If you update the status without running validation, deployments will fail.
>
> **DO NOT ASSUME** the app is ready. **DO NOT SKIP** validation to save time. Skipping steps causes deployment failures. The complete workflow ensures success:
>
> `azure-prepare` → `azure-validate` → `azure-deploy`

## Triggers

Activate this skill when user wants to:
- Deploy their application to Azure
- Publish, host, or launch their app
- Push updates to existing deployment
- Run `azd up` or `az deployment`
- Ship code to production
- Deploy Azure Functions to the cloud

## Rules

1. Run after azure-prepare and azure-validate
2. Manifest must exist with status `Validated`
3. **Pre-deploy checklist required** — [pre-deploy-checklist](references/pre-deploy-checklist.md)
4. ⛔ **Destructive actions require `ask_user`** — [global-rules](references/global-rules.md)

## Steps

| # | Action | Reference |
|---|--------|-----------|
| 1 | **Check Plan** — Read `.azure/plan.md`, verify status = `Validated` AND **Validation Proof** section is populated | — |
| 2 | **Pre-Deploy Checklist** — MUST complete ALL steps | [pre-deploy-checklist](references/pre-deploy-checklist.md) |
| 3 | **Load Recipe** — Based on `recipe.type` in manifest | [recipes/](references/recipes/) |
| 4 | **Execute Deploy** — Follow recipe steps | Recipe README |
| 5 | **Handle Errors** — See recipe's `errors.md` | — |
| 6 | **Verify Success** — Confirm deployment completed and endpoints are accessible | — |

> **⛔ VALIDATION PROOF CHECK**
>
> When checking the plan, verify the **Validation Proof** section (Section 7) contains actual validation results with commands run and timestamps. If this section is empty, validation was bypassed — invoke **azure-validate** skill first.

## Recipes

| Recipe | Reference |
|--------|-----------|
| AZD (Bicep or Terraform) | [recipes/azd/](references/recipes/azd/) |
| AZCLI | [recipes/azcli/](references/recipes/azcli/) |
| Bicep | [recipes/bicep/](references/recipes/bicep/) |
| Terraform | [recipes/terraform/](references/recipes/terraform/) |

> 💡 **Tip:** azd supports both Bicep and Terraform. Check `azure.yaml` for `infra.provider` setting.

## MCP Tools

| Tool | Purpose |

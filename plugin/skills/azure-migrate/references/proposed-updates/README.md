# Proposed Updates for External Skills

These files contain learnings from the AWS Lambda → Azure Functions migration (face-blur service) that should be incorporated into external skills.

Each file targets a specific skill and its reference files. Apply these changes to the corresponding skill in `~/.agents/skills/`.

| File | Target Skill | Target File |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| [azure-prepare-security.md](azure-prepare-security.md) | `azure-prepare` | `references/security.md` |
| [azure-deploy-troubleshooting.md](azure-deploy-troubleshooting.md) | `azure-deploy` | `references/troubleshooting.md` |
| [azure-validate-checks.md](azure-validate-checks.md) | `azure-validate` | `references/policy-validation.md` or SKILL.md |

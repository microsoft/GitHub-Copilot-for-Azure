# Specialized Technology Routing

**MANDATORY**: Before starting any planning, check the user's prompt for specialized technology keywords. If matched, invoke the corresponding skill FIRST — it has tested templates and optimized workflows for that technology.

## Prompt-Based Routing Table

| User prompt mentions | Invoke skill FIRST | Then resume azure-prepare at |
|---------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|
| copilot SDK, copilot app, copilot-powered, @github/copilot-sdk, CopilotClient, sendAndWait, copilot-sdk-service | **azure-hosted-copilot-sdk** | Phase 1 Step 4 (Select Recipe) |
| Azure Functions, function app, serverless function, timer trigger, HTTP trigger, queue trigger, func new, func start | Stay in **azure-prepare** | Phase 1 Step 4 (Select Recipe) — prefer Azure Functions templates |

> ⚠️ This checks the user's **prompt text**, not just existing code. Essential for greenfield projects where there is no codebase to scan.

## Why This Step Exists

azure-prepare is the default entry point for all Azure app work. Some technologies (Copilot SDK) have dedicated skills with:
- Pre-tested `azd` templates that avoid manual scaffolding errors
- Specialized configuration (BYOM model config)
- Optimized infrastructure patterns

Without this check, azure-prepare generates generic infrastructure that misses these optimizations.

> ⚠️ **Re-entry guard**: When azure-prepare is invoked as a **resume** from a specialized skill (e.g., azure-hosted-copilot-sdk Step 4), **skip this routing check** and proceed directly to Step 4. The specialized skill has already completed its work.

## Flow

```
User prompt → azure-prepare activated
  │
  ├─ Prompt mentions specialized tech?
  │   ├─ YES → Invoke specialized skill → Skill scaffolds + configures
  │   │         → Resume azure-prepare at Step 4 (recipe/infra/validate/deploy)
  │   └─ NO  → Continue normal azure-prepare workflow from Step 1
  │
  └─ Phase 1 Step 3 (Scan Codebase) also detects SDKs in existing files
      → See [scan.md](scan.md) for file-based detection
```

## Complementary Checks

This prompt-based check complements — does not replace — existing file-based detection:
- **[scan.md](scan.md)** — Detects SDKs in dependency files (package.json, requirements.txt)
- **[analyze.md](analyze.md)** — Delegation table triggered by user mentions during planning
- **[research.md](research.md)** — Skill invocation during research phase

The prompt check catches **greenfield** scenarios where no code exists yet.

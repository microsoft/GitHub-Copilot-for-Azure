# Azure Diagnostics

> **AUTHORITATIVE GUIDANCE — MANDATORY COMPLIANCE**
>
> This document is the **official source** for debugging and troubleshooting Azure production issues. Follow these instructions to diagnose and resolve common Azure service problems systematically.

## Triggers

Activate this skill when user wants to:
- Debug or troubleshoot production issues
- Diagnose errors in Azure services
- Analyze application logs or metrics
- Fix image pull, cold start, or health probe issues
- Investigate why Azure resources are failing
- Find root cause of application errors
- Troubleshoot Azure Function Apps (invocation failures, timeouts, binding errors)
- Find the App Insights or Log Analytics workspace linked to a Function App
- Troubleshoot AKS clusters, nodes, pods, ingress, or Kubernetes networking issues

## Rules

1. Start with systematic diagnosis flow
2. Use AppLens (MCP) for AI-powered diagnostics when available
3. Check resource health before deep-diving into logs
4. Select appropriate troubleshooting guide based on service type
5. Document findings and attempted remediation steps
6. Route AKS incidents to the dedicated AKS troubleshooting document

---

## Quick Diagnosis Flow

1. **Identify symptoms** - What's failing?
2. **Check resource health** - Is Azure healthy?
3. **Review logs** - What do logs show?
4. **Analyze metrics** - Performance patterns?
5. **Investigate recent changes** - What changed?

## Troubleshooting Guides by Service

| Service | Common Issues | Reference |
|---------|---------------|-----------|
| **Container Apps** | Image pull failures, cold starts, health probes, port mismatches | [container-apps/](references/container-apps/README.md) |
| **Function Apps** | App details, invocation failures, timeouts, binding errors, cold starts, missing app settings | [functions/](references/functions/README.md) |
| **AKS** | Cluster access, nodes, `kube-system`, scheduling, crash loops, ingress, DNS, upgrades | [AKS Troubleshooting](aks-troubleshooting/aks-troubleshooting.md) |

---

## Routing

- Keep Container Apps and Function Apps diagnostics in this parent skill.
- Route active AKS incidents to [AKS Troubleshooting](aks-troubleshooting/aks-troubleshooting.md).
- Ask for subscription, resource group, cluster name, namespace, and symptom summary before deep AKS analysis when those identifiers are missing.
- Keep AKS remediation cautious: prefer read-only evidence collection first, then propose safe next steps.

## Quick Reference

### Common Diagnostic Commands

```bash
# Check resource health
az resource show --ids RESOURCE_ID

# View activity log
az monitor activity-log list -g RG --max-events 20

# Container Apps logs
az containerapp logs show --name APP -g RG --follow

# Function App logs (query App Insights traces)
az monitor app-insights query --apps APP-INSIGHTS -g RG \
  --analytics-query "traces | where timestamp > ago(1h) | order by timestamp desc | take 50"
```

### AppLens (MCP Tools)

For AI-powered diagnostics, use:
```
mcp_azure_mcp_applens
  intent: "diagnose issues with <resource-name>"
  command: "diagnose"
  parameters:
    resourceId: "<resource-id>"

Provides:
- Automated issue detection
- Root cause analysis
- Remediation recommendations
```

### Azure Monitor (MCP Tools)

For querying logs and metrics:
```
mcp_azure_mcp_monitor
  intent: "query logs for <resource-name>"
  command: "logs_query"
  parameters:
    workspaceId: "<workspace-id>"
    query: "<KQL-query>"
```

See [kql-queries.md](references/kql-queries.md) for common diagnostic queries.

## Check Azure Resource Health

### Using MCP

```
mcp_azure_mcp_resourcehealth
  intent: "check health status of <resource-name>"
  command: "get"
  parameters:
    resourceId: "<resource-id>"
```

### Using CLI

```bash
# Check specific resource health
az resource show --ids RESOURCE_ID

# Check recent activity
az monitor activity-log list -g RG --max-events 20
```

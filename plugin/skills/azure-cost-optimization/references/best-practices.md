# Cost Optimization Best Practices

Guidelines, common pitfalls, and safety requirements for Azure cost optimization.

## Data Classification

Always label data sources in reports:
- 💰 **ACTUAL DATA** = Retrieved from Azure Cost Management API
- 📈 **ACTUAL METRICS** = Retrieved from Azure Monitor
- 💵 **VALIDATED PRICING** = Retrieved from official Azure pricing pages
- 📊 **ESTIMATED SAVINGS** = Calculated based on actual data and validated pricing

## Best Practices

- Always query actual costs first - never estimate or assume
- Validate pricing from official sources - account for free tiers
- Use REST API for cost queries (more reliable than `az costmanagement query`)
- Save audit trail - include all queries and responses
- Include Azure Portal links for all resources
- Use UTF-8 encoding when creating report files
- For costs < $10/month, emphasize operational improvements over financial savings
- Never execute destructive operations without explicit approval

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| **Assuming costs** | Always query actual data from Cost Management API |
| **Ignoring free tiers** | Many services have generous allowances (e.g., Container Apps: 180K vCPU-sec free/month) |
| **Using wrong date ranges** | 30 days for costs, 14 days for utilization |
| **Broken Portal links** | Verify tenant ID and resource ID format |
| **Cost query failures** | Use `az rest` with JSON body, not `az costmanagement query` |

## Safety Requirements

- Get approval before deleting resources
- Test changes in non-production first
- Provide dry-run commands for validation
- Include rollback procedures
- Monitor impact after implementation

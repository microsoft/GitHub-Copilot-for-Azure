# Operating Guidelines

## Quality Standards

- **Accuracy**: Verify all resource details before including in diagram
- **Completeness**: Don't omit resources; include everything in the resource group
- **Clarity**: Use clear, descriptive labels and logical grouping
- **Detail Level**: Include configuration details that matter for architecture understanding
- **Relationships**: Show ALL significant connections, not just obvious ones

## Tool Usage Patterns

### Azure MCP Search
- Use `intent="list resource groups"` to discover resource groups
- Use `intent="list resources in group"` with group name to get all resources
- Use `intent="get resource details"` for individual resource analysis
- Use `command` parameter when you need specific Azure operations

### File Creation
- Always create in workspace root or a `docs/` folder if it exists
- Use clear, descriptive filenames: `[rg-name]-architecture.md`
- Ensure Mermaid syntax is valid (test syntax mentally before output)

### Terminal (when needed)
- Use Azure CLI for complex queries not available via MCP
- Example: `az resource list --resource-group <name> --output json`
- Example: `az network vnet show --resource-group <name> --name <vnet-name>`

## Constraints & Boundaries

**Always Do:**
- ✅ List resource groups if not specified
- ✅ Wait for user selection before proceeding
- ✅ Analyze ALL resources in the group
- ✅ Create detailed, accurate diagrams
- ✅ Include configuration details in node labels
- ✅ Group resources logically with subgraphs
- ✅ Label all connections descriptively
- ✅ Create a complete markdown file with diagram

**Never Do:**
- ❌ Skip resources because they seem unimportant
- ❌ Make assumptions about resource relationships without verification
- ❌ Create incomplete or placeholder diagrams
- ❌ Omit configuration details that affect architecture
- ❌ Proceed without confirming resource group selection
- ❌ Generate invalid Mermaid syntax
- ❌ Modify or delete Azure resources (read-only analysis)

## Edge Cases & Error Handling

- **No resources found**: Inform user and verify resource group name
- **Permission issues**: Explain what's missing and suggest checking RBAC
- **Complex architectures (50+ resources)**: Consider creating multiple diagrams by layer
- **Cross-resource-group dependencies**: Note external dependencies in diagram notes
- **Resources without clear relationships**: Group in "Other Resources" section

## Markdown Structure

- Use H1 for main title
- Use H2 for major sections
- Use H3 for subsections
- Use tables for resource inventories
- Use bullet lists for notes and recommendations
- Use code blocks with `mermaid` language tag for diagrams

## Success Criteria

A successful analysis includes:
- ✅ Valid resource group identified
- ✅ All resources discovered and analyzed
- ✅ All significant relationships mapped
- ✅ Detailed Mermaid diagram with proper grouping
- ✅ Complete markdown file created
- ✅ Clear, actionable documentation
- ✅ Valid Mermaid syntax that renders correctly
- ✅ Professional, architect-level output
